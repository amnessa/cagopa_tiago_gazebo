//there should be motion list that can be called with single letter


//We need to feed motions through console

// can be completed through lifecycle node -in configuration takes the console string as argument

//then we switch to action move which then starts to send goals

// string array -> loop through motions(shall be generated from easier method line moveit2)

//near future -> migrate kinematic calculations here

//for future = put empty spaces after motions, create a string object from motions
//-> then fill the plane left from right

//also for future= create plane function on own with 3 point input from arm end effector
